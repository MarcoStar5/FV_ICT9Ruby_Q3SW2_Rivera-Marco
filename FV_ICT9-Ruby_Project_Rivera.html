    		<td>One of the most crucial fire safety warnings you shouldn't ignore is the fact that overloading your circuits poses a significant fire risk. To prevent them from overheating and catching fire, try to limit the number of gadgets you put into your electrical outlets. Practice unplugging your appliances and gadgets while they are not in use. Whether you're only leaving your house or job for a short while or leaving it for a long time, it's a good idea to do this.</td>

    		<td>Never, under any circumstances, leave a gas stove on while working in the kitchen. Just switch off the burner if you need to leave for a bit and come back to it later. Not leaning over open flames while wearing loose clothing to prevent it from catching fire is another essential piece of fire safety advice. Additionally, keep your kitchen free of flammable items like potholders and towels.</td>

    		<td>Good housekeeping practices not only reduce the risk of fire but also enhance your general wellbeing. Keep all trash out of the aisles, stairways, and walkways as a general rule. In the office or at home, having clean and open pathways helps stop a fire from spreading. Additionally, it provides ample room for people to move about and flee during situations.</td>

    		<td>Smoke alarms should be installed so that they can warn you if a fire starts because they can occur at any time.
The moment a smoke alarm goes off, it's still not too late. There is still much to be done. Smoke alarms, on the other hand, occasionally do nothing more than warn of approaching danger, depending on the circumstance.</td>

Additionally, keep your candles far from materials like curtains, rugs, bedsheets, and paper that can readily catch fire.  </td>
